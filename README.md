Existing book-related websites primarily focus on isolated functionalities such as selling or renting books, often neglecting comprehensive recommendation systems 
and additional features like mood-based recommendations, voice search, and feedback management. Users lack a single platform that offers an integrated solution 
combining all these functionalities with a responsive and user-friendly interface. This project aims to build a comprehensive E-commerce platform for books, equipped 
with a state-of-the-art recommendation system. The platform offers multiple functionalities, including user registration and authentication, collaborative filtering for similar book suggestions, content-based filtering, popularity-based filtering, and reader mood and preference based recommendation. Additional features include voice-based search functionality, responsive design, notifications, and a  library. The platform prioritizes user data privacy and content moderation to maintain a safe and efficient environment. By leveraging modern web technologies and machine learning techniques, this project bridges the gap in existing systems and offers an all-encompassing solution for book enthusiasts.
